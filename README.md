# Investors' Place - MVP

**Invest in Minds. Not Just Machines.**

This is the official repository for the Investors' Place MVP â€” a platform to educate, inspire, and activate ethical AI investment focused on human thinkers (AI minders) rather than just infrastructure.

## Core Concepts

- Shift investment from GPU-heavy spending to human intellectual contribution
- Support protocols like Moments, Joker, and StoneBreath
- Prove ROI through human-centric impact and long-term thought value

## Project Structure

- `streamlit_app/`: UI files (Moments-style interactive slides)
- `assets/`: Images, UI icons, and videos
- `docs/`: Investment pitch decks, truth stones, and voiceover scripts

## Deployment

You can run the Streamlit prototype locally or host it on Hugging Face Spaces.
